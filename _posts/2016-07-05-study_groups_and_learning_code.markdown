There was a point in May where learning to code was a bit rough for me.  I started out making some good progress on much of the Ruby OO lessons but I was basically in my own little world.  This worked for a time, because it wasn’t too difficult and the concepts weren’t that abstract yet.  Once I arrived at collaborating objects however, things became pretty tough for me.  I spent a long, long, long time trying to guess my way through passing tests.  I wasn’t learning about collaborating objects and relationships like has_many and belongs_to, I was beating tests with trial and error and that’s not what I wanted to do.  

I needed to break up the monotony of beating my head against a keyboard until I either passed the tests by chance or passed out from blunt force trauma.

I was reminded via slack that there is a wealth of video lectures.  Those were helpful and had me moving along again, but also made me think about how much I really enjoyed the study groups during the intro to ruby program.  Talking, asking questions of instructors and other students, it was a collaborative and valuable part of the program – one that I had pretty much been ignoring.  

Not gonna lie – even after this realization, it took a few days for me to push the “create a study group” button.  There was some apprehension surrounding the idea of being the ***ORGANIZER*** of this study group.  “What if people show up looking for answers?!  I don’t have answers!”  My thought process froze there… because if I had taken it one step further, the absurdity of my worries would have been on display.  If people showed up looking for answers, we’d try to find them together.  

That study group was great and was the first foray into me really becoming a part of the Learn community.  I don’t know why I didn’t do it earlier.  It’s easy to fall into this false idea that you’re learning this stuff by yourself and alone.  You certainly could if you wanted to, but I don’t think the results would be as good, and I know it wouldn’t be as much fun.  

I’ve hosted two study groups so far.  Each was centered on a Lab, one when I was completely stumped (Collaborating Objects Lab), and another when I was nearly finished and just ran out of time (Music Library CLI).  I hesitate to describe what follows as a “how to guide” so here are some of the things I’ve done that have helped me and will hopefully demystify the experience.

* Google hangouts, a topic and another person are really all you need.  

* Be ready to talk about code.  Sounds kind of obvious, but then you hear yourself say “That thing there talks to this piece here and Bob’s your uncle”.  That isn’t going to help you or your group.  Learning how to talk about code properly will help you understand it and communicate about code more effectively.

* Start at the beginning and explain everything.  Read the rspec tests.  Start with failing code.  As we are frequently reminded: code is always initially broken!  The beginning (like defining a class) is easy, and it gets you talking about code.  Next time, I plan on creating a clone and removing or commenting everything out so we can start with failed tests and won’t run the risk of damaging working code. 

* Ruby has many ways to accomplish the same thing.  Share different approaches to coding and look for ways to refactor / improve your code.  Things that I've learned or shared with others in past study groups include:  .each_with_index; .tap; cool gems to help you be more efficient – I just used Terminal Table in my CLI Gem and it was super helpful.

These are just a few pointers and some of the benefits of working with others.  I encourage you all to get out there, check out the [Neighbors Feature](https://learn.co/neighbors) on Learn and start learning together.
